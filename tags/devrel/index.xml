I recently rejoined AWS as a developer advocate for analytics on the EMR team and in the past 6 months I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of things about DevRel&amp;hellip;and a lot about what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. So here&amp;rsquo;s a top 5 list.
1. There are multiple roles in DevRel Some people focus on community. Others focus on proof-of-concepts. Others still focus on demos, tutorials, or docs.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>

<p>Some people focus on community. Others focus on proof-of-concepts. Others still focus on demos, tutorials, or docs.</p>
<p>And some have the lucky job of doing all of the above.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dynamic role and varies with each organization. You <em>will</em> get pulled in multiple directions and you will need to be hyper-organized as well as validate the priority of all the inbound interest with your peers and managers.</p>

<p>A topic that often comes up is &ldquo;how do you measure your success&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Well&hellip;it&rsquo;s kind of tough to tie YouTube views to marketing leads to customers&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Reach and impressions are great, but what&rsquo;s the actual impact?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What would you say you <em>do</em> here?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all challengers with the developer relations role. It&rsquo;s a little bit marketing&hellip;a little bit engineering&hellip;and nobody really knows how to quantify all that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built my <a href="https://github.com/dacort/damons-data-lake/tree/main/data_containers">own personal data lake</a> to gather a lot of the metrics I need across GitHub and YouTube, but metrics aren&rsquo;t the only story.</p>

<p>I now have tripods for light rings, green screens, white screens, and other fancy lights I don&rsquo;t even know about.</p>
<p>Whenever I travel, I bring no less than 3 tripods with me.</p>

<p>Camtasia? After Effects? Loom? OBS? Descript? Twitch or YouTube Live? Or LinkedIn Live?</p>
<p>There are so many video and live-streaming platforms. And I now spend a significant portion of my day producing videos.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t produce content &ldquo;every now and then&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a live stream at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>Folks like to know when something is coming. No, folks <em>need</em> to know when something is coming. üòÑ</p>
