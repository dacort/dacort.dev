So here’s a top 5 list.\n1. There are multiple roles in DevRel Some people focus on community. Others focus on proof-of-concepts. Others still focus on demos, tutorials, or docs.\nAnd some have the lucky job of doing all of the above.\nIt’s a dynamic role and varies with each organization. You will get pulled in multiple directions and you will need to be hyper-organized as well as validate the priority of all the inbound interest with your peers and managers.\n2. These are not the metrics you are looking for A topic that often comes up is “how do you measure your success”.\n “Well…it’s kind of tough to tie YouTube views to marketing leads to customers…” “Reach and impressions are great, but what’s the actual impact?” “What would you say you do here?”  These are all challengers with the developer relations role. It’s a little bit marketing…a little bit engineering…and nobody really knows how to quantify all that.\nI’ve built my own personal data lake to gather a lot of the metrics I need across GitHub and YouTube, but metrics aren’t the only story.\n3. You will have more tripods than you know what to do with After starting work as a dev advocate, the number of tripods I owned has increased 5-fold. ALL THE LIGHTS! 👨‍💻🤳🔦\n— Damon Cortesi (@dacort) June 18, 2021  I now have tripods for light rings, green screens, white screens, and other fancy lights I don’t even know about.\nWhenever I travel, I bring no less than 3 tripods with me.\n4. You will become a video editing expert Camtasia? After Effects? Loom? OBS? Descript? Twitch or YouTube Live? Or LinkedIn Live?\nThere are so many video and live-streaming platforms. And I now spend a significant portion of my day producing videos.\nYou want remove alt-tab overlays from your video? I’m your guy.\n5. Schedules are key You can’t produce content “every now and then”.\nYou can’t have a live stream at a moment’s notice.\nFolks like to know when something is coming. No, folks need to know when something is coming. 😄\n","wordCount":"392","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://dacort.dev/images/post-devrel-cover.jpg","datePublished":"2021-06-19T21:59:00-07:00","dateModified":"2021-06-19T21:59:00-07:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dacort.dev/posts/5-things-they-dont-tell-you-about-advocatos/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Damon Cortesi","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dacort.dev/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:#1d1e20;--entry:#2e2e33;--primary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg:#2e2e33;--code-bg:#37383e;--border:#333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://dacort.dev/ accesskey=h title="Damon Cortesi (Alt + H)">Damon Cortesi</a>
