I recently rejoined AWS as a developer advocate for analytics on the EMR team and in the past 6 months I've learned a lot of things about DevRel...and a lot about what I didn't know. So here's a top 5 list.

### 1. There are multiple roles in DevRel

Some people focus on community. Others focus on proof-of-concepts. Others still focus on demos, tutorials, or docs.

And some have the lucky job of doing all of the above.

It's a dynamic role and varies with each organization. You *will* get pulled in multiple directions and you will need to be hyper-organized as well as validate the priority of all the inbound interest with your peers and managers.

### 2. These are not the metrics you are looking for

A topic that often comes up is "how do you measure your success". 

- "Well...it's kind of tough to tie YouTube views to marketing leads to customers..."
- "Reach and impressions are great, but what's the actual impact?"
- "What would you say you _do_ here?"

These are all challengers with the developer relations role. It's a little bit marketing...a little bit engineering...and nobody really knows how to quantify all that. 

I've built my [own personal data lake](https://github.com/dacort/damons-data-lake/tree/main/data_containers) to gather a lot of the metrics I need across GitHub and YouTube, but metrics aren't the only story.

### 3. You will have more tripods than you know what to do with

I now have tripods for light rings, green screens, white screens, and other fancy lights I don't even know about.

Whenever I travel, I bring no less than 3 tripods with me.

### 4. You will become a video editing expert

Camtasia? After Effects? Loom? OBS? Descript? Twitch or YouTube Live? Or LinkedIn Live?

There are so many video and live-streaming platforms. And I now spend a significant portion of my day producing videos.

You want remove alt-tab overlays from your video? I'm your guy.

### 5. Schedules are key

You can't produce content "every now and then". 

You can't have a live stream at a moment's notice.

Folks like to know when something is coming. No, folks *need* to know when something is coming. ðŸ˜„
