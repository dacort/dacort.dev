While I&amp;rsquo;ve been a consumer of Airflow over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve never contributed directly to the project. And weighing in at over half a million lines of code, Airflow is a pretty complex project to wade into. So here&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how I made a new operator in the AWS provider package.

I recently rejoined AWS as a developer advocate for analytics on the EMR team and in the past 6 months I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of things about DevRel&amp;hellip;and a lot about what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. So here&amp;rsquo;s a top 5 list.
