I first used Metabase in 2016 when I built an internal BI site for my startup, Simply Measured.

I joined AWS in 2017, largely because I was so inspired by Amazon Athena.

So it only made sense that in 2019 I would make a [Metabase Athena Driver](https://github.com/dacort/metabase-athena-driver)...shortly before I joined the Metabase team. ğŸ™Œ
