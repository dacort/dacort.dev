Hi there 👋

It's been a long time – 3,399 days to exact – since I've blogged, but since starting a new role as a developer advocate I figured it was a good time to start again. 😁

Welcome to the 2021 revamp of my personal developer site. In it, you will find:
- [Posts](/posts) about technical (and sometimes personal) content
- [Personal and work projects](/projects) I want to share

I get excited and make things, and will do my best to share that here.

For my first post, check out how I built a [big data stack using AWS CDK](/posts/cdk-big-data-stack/).
