More often than not, however, I&amp;rsquo;m working with AWS EC2 instances in a private subnet.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with it AWS Systems Manager Session Manager is a pretty sweet feature that allows you to connect remotely to EC2 instances with the AWS CLI, without needing to open up ports for SSH or utilize a bastion host.</description></item><item><title>Updating Partition Values With Apache Hudi</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/updating-partition-values-with-apache-hudi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 11:51:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/updating-partition-values-with-apache-hudi/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Apache Hudi, it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty awesome piece of software that brings transactions and record-level updates/deletes to data lakes.
More specifically, if you&amp;rsquo;re doing Analytics with S3, Hudi provides a way for you to consistently update records in your data lake, which historically has been pretty challenging. It can also optimize file sizes, allow for rollbacks, and makes streaming CDC data impressively easy.
Updating Partition Values I&amp;rsquo;m learning more about Hudi and was following this EMR guide to working with a Hudi dataset, but the &amp;ldquo;Upsert&amp;rdquo; operation didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work as I expected.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Deployment of Jupyter Notebooks</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/continuous-deployment-of-jupyter-notebooks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/continuous-deployment-of-jupyter-notebooks/</guid><description>This is a guide on how to use AWS CodePipeline to continuously deploy Jupyter notebooks to an S3-backed static website.
Overview Since I started using EMR Studio, I&amp;rsquo;ve been making more use of Jupyter notebooks as scratch pads and often want to be able to easily share the results of my research. I hunted around for a few different solutions and while there are some good ones like nbconvert and jupytext, I wanted something a bit simpler and off-the-shelf.</description></item><item><title>Build your own Air Quality Monitor with OpenAQ and EMR on EKS</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/emr-eks-custom-images-with-openaq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 21:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/emr-eks-custom-images-with-openaq/</guid><description>Fire season is closely approaching and as somebody that spent two weeks last year hunkered down inside with my browser glued to various air quality sites, I wanted to show how to use data from OpenAQ to build your own air quality analysis.
With Amazon EMR on EKS, you can now customize and package your own Apache Spark dependencies and I use that functionality for this post.
Overview OpenAQ maintains a publicly accessible dataset of various air quality metrics that&amp;rsquo;s updated every half hour.</description></item><item><title>Big Data Stack with CDK</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/cdk-big-data-stack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 21:59:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/cdk-big-data-stack/</guid><description>How I built my own Apache Spark environment on AWS using Amazon EMR, Amazon EKS, and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).</description></item><item><title>Damon's Projects</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 11:30:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/</guid><description>An overview of both my personal and work projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
