Install it from the Serverless Application Repository: AthenaSQLiteConnector.
Wait, what?! SQLite in S3? Yea! As quite possibly the most prevelant database in the world, it&amp;rsquo;s not unsual for me to have various SQLite files laying around.
This Athena data connector allows you to query those databases directly from Athena.
Cool! Right?! One of the fun things about this project is that SQLite is not intended to be a network database.</description></item><item><title>Demo Code</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/aws/demo-code/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 15:23:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/aws/demo-code/</guid><description>Demo code I use during presentations.</description></item><item><title>Ideas 💡</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/overview/</guid><description>A collection of things I may someday build.</description></item><item><title>BingDaily 🌄</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/bingdaily/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/bingdaily/</guid><description>A fun little side project that downloads the Bing Image of the day and makes it your background on macOS.</description></item><item><title>Byteable Calc 🧮</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/byteable-calc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/byteable-calc/</guid><description>A byte-size HTML/JS calculator for making big numbers human-readable.</description></item><item><title>Cargo Crates 🚚</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/cargo-crates/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/cargo-crates/</guid><description>An easy way to extract data with Containers.</description></item><item><title>Log4j.us 🪵</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/log4j-us/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/log4j-us/</guid><description>Dynamic log4j config generator.</description></item><item><title>Metabase Athena Driver 📊</title><link>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/metabase-athena-driver/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 08:49:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/projects/personal/metabase-athena-driver/</guid><description>An Amazon Athena driver for use with Metabase.</description></item><item><title>Building and Testing a new Apache Airflow Plugin</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/building-and-testing-a-new-apache-airflow-plugin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 11:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/building-and-testing-a-new-apache-airflow-plugin/</guid><description>Recently, I had the opportunity to add a new EMR on EKS plugin to Apache Airflow. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been a consumer of Airflow over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve never contributed directly to the project. And weighing in at over half a million lines of code, Airflow is a pretty complex project to wade into. So here&amp;rsquo;s a guide on how I made a new operator in the AWS provider package.
Overview Before you get started, it&amp;rsquo;s good to have an understanding of the different components of an Airflow task.</description></item><item><title>Build your own Air Quality Monitor with OpenAQ and EMR on EKS</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/emr-eks-custom-images-with-openaq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 21:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/emr-eks-custom-images-with-openaq/</guid><description>Fire season is closely approaching and as somebody that spent two weeks last year hunkered down inside with my browser glued to various air quality sites, I wanted to show how to use data from OpenAQ to build your own air quality analysis.
With Amazon EMR on EKS, you can now customize and package your own Apache Spark dependencies and I use that functionality for this post.
Overview OpenAQ maintains a publicly accessible dataset of various air quality metrics that&amp;rsquo;s updated every half hour.</description></item><item><title>5 things they don't tell you about being a developer advocate</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/5-things-they-dont-tell-you-about-advocatos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 21:59:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/5-things-they-dont-tell-you-about-advocatos/</guid><description>image credit this awesome cheerful dev advocado sticker
I recently rejoined AWS as a developer advocate for analytics on the EMR team and in the past 6 months I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of things about DevRel&amp;hellip;and a lot about what I didn&amp;rsquo;t know. So here&amp;rsquo;s a top 5 list.
1. There are multiple roles in DevRel Some people focus on community. Others focus on proof-of-concepts. Others still focus on demos, tutorials, or docs.</description></item><item><title>Big Data Stack with CDK</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/cdk-big-data-stack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 21:59:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/cdk-big-data-stack/</guid><description>How I built my own Apache Spark environment on AWS using Amazon EMR, Amazon EKS, and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).</description></item><item><title>Initial Revision</title><link>https://dacort.dev/posts/initial-revision/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 21:57:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://dacort.dev/posts/initial-revision/</guid><description>Hi there 👋
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time – 3,399 days to exact – since I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged, but since starting a new role as a developer advocate I figured it was a good time to start again. 😁
Welcome to the 2021 revamp of my personal developer site. In it, you will find:
