I'm a fan of making the code I run in presentations publicly available.

Most of the demo code I use is available in my [demo-code](https://github.com/dacort/demo-code) repository on GitHub. In there, you'll find such interesting things as:

- EMR CloudFormation Templates
- [EMR on EKS notes](https://github.com/dacort/demo-code/tree/main/emr/eks)
- [EMR Studio notes](https://github.com/dacort/demo-code/tree/main/emr/studio)
- And even a [big data CDK stack](https://github.com/dacort/demo-code/tree/main/cdk/big-data-stack) for easy deployment of my demos
