## What is it?

A simple calculator geared towards converting data sizes. 

For example, I often need to do some conversions from bytes to something more human-readable:

```
585828
```

You can even do math! Say we transferred `233033728 bytes` in `7 days`, we can divide by 7 to get the per-day number.

```
233033728/7
```
